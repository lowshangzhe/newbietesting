        <h5>Becoming web and app developer</h5>
        <h6>2020 - Now</h6>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          I feel super excited about doing web designing and passing what I learn to other people and friends.
          One of the software that gets me interested in is Adobe Xd, currently learning.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I have learned Html, CSS, Bootstrap, and Python that recommend by people on the internet for any newbie in programming.
          The reason that I started learning is my interest in knowing the technology of how a thing gets built. I first get introduced
          to Python on last year but intend only to watch some videos from the Edx as I regularly would do.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As time passed on, I get a lot of time to study tutorials on the internet, which I am glad that I did instead of watching television
          and acting lazy. I did see a lot of people posting their experience in getting a web developer job with tons of negative experience,
          especially without a computer science degree.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am old now, and one of the most important things that I see is you must have a strong network, hustle, and meet people to get a job,
          even in freelancing.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Now, I join <a href="https://hackercollective.co/">hackercollective.co</a> and do wish to build a strong relationship with such a chance.
          This seems to be the cheapest Bootcamp where you get to work with other people and learn together.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Also, I am learning by doing some small projects with WordPress, HTML, and CSS, while learning Javascript and Adobe XD on the way.
          Just, starting to create a profile from freelancing. Feel free to contact me as I offer my web designing work for free.

        <h5>Working as Sales Agent</h5>
        <h6>2020 - Now</h6>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
          <p>
            As a person who would like to be honest, I do not come out of the house a lot. But, I get better memories of the time that I spent
            working with people. During the time that I am searching for jobs on the internet, I decided to try something else. I have decided
            to take a different type of a job, and that is selling.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My job is to sell home made cakes to people in the restaurant and on the street. In my first few days, I was given proper training
            from my new company. I feel grateful that I get to meet a person who has taught me a lot in marketing and to the point of that giving
            up his own time in getting the sale to mentor me in getting more buyers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I have learned tons of stuff like how to get more people to buy from crowded areas, getting the right time to refurbish your stock,
            and knowledge about cakes, and many more.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My mentor has even taught me his expertise in other areas like cars and cooking. He is the most enthusiastic marketer that I have
            known from the company.

<!-- Section Three -->
    <div class="left_03">
      <div class="left">

        <h5>Working in Office</h5>
        <h6>2015 - 2019</h6>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
          <p>
            Employed in the year 2015, but I can still remember the tension that was in me during the first few weeks,
            especially during the day of my first job interview. I made tons of mistakes during my first job as a person
            who never used to work for an office job. Here are my experience in working in an office.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My experience in working with the company shows me that to perform well in any new environment is the importance
            of making some mistakes as soon as you could. While learning to do, it is wise not to burden yourself with the anxiety
            of thinking of the ways that you would mess up without proper stop. I have to make more of the same mistake than anyone
            in the office to learn the fact. I would advise anyone to pay attention to only the three to two areas while working for
            a particular task.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Another lesson that I have made is that you would be working with other people for the rest of your working hours.
            Therefore, it is advisable to invest time in knowing other people and their work. I have experienced a lot of lack of
            communication with my colleague, and it was a disaster. You may have a family background that restricts you from doing
            certain things with friends. But, you should be the only last person to judge the situation and not your parents.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Lastly, you are encouraged to argue with other people. After wasted part of my life of constantly taking orders from other people,
            I finally realize that arguments are fundamentals in any personal relationship or a healthy working environment. Therefore, I wish
            people who have been like me would get the courage to speak up.
          </p>
